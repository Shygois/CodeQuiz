## User Story

```
AS A coding bootcamp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score
```

Description: I got the basic functions of the quiz running, click start button, timer starts and takes you to the first question. Once you answer the first question you are notified if your answer was correct or incorrect. If your answer is correct the next question pops up, if your answer is incorrect the timer is decreased by 10 seconds and the next question pops up.

Incomplete: Still need to have each question display individually, need to make my highscores active, need to store high scores, enter in initials for high score and restart the game once time is up. Going to resubmit this but was really struggling with this challenge.
